Because I can understand it is of immense interest to you and other GSpiers

As I think is very clear, at least some volunteers are strongly motivated by seeing how quickly a project is moving along, as measured by Completed Subject (retired images, ...). To be sure, our motivations are many, and while there's a commonality, there are also very considerable differences.
Here's a personal one: to me, if a project is going to display ""statistics"" - as all (?) Panoptes-based ones do - it is vital to ensure what's displayed is both accurate and meaningful, OR have an easily accessible source explaining why such info is not (accurate or meaningful). After all, what's the point of having such info so prominent if it's known to be neither accurate nor meaningful? To me, a project which can't get this right is very likely full of all sorts of other bugs and nasties; perhaps the individual stats (i.e. 'mine') are off too? perhaps credit is randomly given out? perhaps some random fraction of my clicks go unrecorded? ... At least in Backyard Worlds there was a response (when I raised these sorts of questions); here?
Don't get me wrong: GS is a fantastic project, not only for its subject (GWR at LIGO), but also for its innovation in the use of ML. However, I am so bemused by why none of the PTB seem to treat the 'stats' question seriously that I rarely spend time here any more ...

I agree that it's kind of silly to have to mouse back and forth.
Though maybe auto-play isn't the way to go, I think this suggestion warrants more attention. Here are two additional ideas that could remove the need for moving the mouse around.

Having the focus of the browser default to the viewing window so that the arrow keys can be used to toggle between the time scales.
Displaying both the shortest timescale and the longest timescale simultaneously. They could be displayed the same size or one of them smaller than the other with an option to toggle which one is larger.

You mention that in the more advanced levels more time is needed to carefully consider the image and it can't be quickly classified, but for those of thus that are still sitting around level 3, a more streamlined user interface would help us get to those advanced classifications more quickly.

1604198776-1272,"On top of the fact that GS has no fixed classification count when it comes to subject retirement ...
It also, according to the GS-team, allows for NOTA subject cases to move up from a lower level to a higher level. This last part, for example, makes it a theoretical possibility for level 3 and level 4 to go to 100% completion, while having no effect on the global completion level. In such a case the level 5 completion level would of course go down, to account for the increase in subjects in that level.
(that's L3 => L4 => L5, and not L3 => L5 AND L4 => L5)
Additional note on not having a fixed classification retirement trigger. Is that with a fixed retirement count, single classification actions can be accounted for in the statistics. For a process that, in effect, has a variable & unknown retirement count, you can't (well ... at least not based on counting actual classification actions).
So in effect: GS completion stats are limited to counting subject transition cases. Or: is blind to classification actions that do not result in some kind of subject transition action.

1604198738-1190,"FWIW: I'm approaching 16000 classifications at level 5 (classifications at level 6 don't count for this purpose) with level 7 not yet unlocked, and given that it took about 6000 at level 4 to unlock level 5, I am not yet worried. Having to do 20000 or 36000 would not surprise me. Far be it from me to complain; I'm having fun. 
What I do find a bit odd is that I occasionally see expert-labelled sanity checks from O1 of only some classes but not others:  1400 Ripple, Helix, Light Modulation, Paired Doves, Tomte, and Wandering Line do come up from time to time in level 5.  I have not seen a single expert vetted 1080 Line or Scratchy or Violin Mode Harmonic (or any of the others) in all of level 5, IIRC. Is it still possible to fill in all the blanks in the confusion matrix, or are there some classes for which sanity-check examples are missing entirely from level 5 but which are still being checked for contributors' consistency/confusion...? @sbc538
A minor suggestion for a possible improvement: If the experts could spare the time, could some expert-labelled examples from O3 be added? By now, O3 Subjects vastly outnumber O1 with more being added every day, and even aside from new classes that never came up in O1, they do look a little different: Already the noise background is different enough that I can usually tell an O3 subject from an O1 without even looking at it, just from the corner of the eye. Thus the O1 sanity checks punctuating my mostly-O3 flow are a little distracting - they're too obvious to ever catch me by surprise, and they don't entirely fit the eye-brain calibration needed for the O3 subjects. Diluting them in a pool of newer expert examples would thus make the sanity checking more realistic. E.g. replace some O1 Tomtes with O3 Tomtes. Ideally, add some Crowns and HF bursts, and remove Helix and perhaps Paired Doves from the level 5 matrix (I doubt whether those two have ever re-occurred in O3...?).
Cheers, Gerhard
(NB O1-vintage Paired Doves still do serve one good purpose in level 5 - they act as a reminder to always look at frame 4. But once one has made a habit of this... )

15.    It would be nice to have a system that would track the location of the mouse pointer in the frequency and time coordinates. So, say I hover over a location in the image, somewhere outside of the image there could be a box with the coordinates of my current mouse location within the grid. I would prefer it not hover near the mouse because that would cover the image. It would help with identifying better frequencies and time locations for events when discussing them.

For advanced users, it could be useful to have a way for you to continuously keep moving within the Time coordinate to the next image. Like as a way to classify as a continuous time reel. I'm think if you were to use a click in the image to identify the glitches (and have a way to quickly classify each glitch in the full image) then you could scroll to the right with a button or something and just keep on going with classifying them in a continuous manor. Could give context into possible causes of glitches and lead to other connections being made. (ie, maybe a certain glitch is always preceded by a certain glitch or weak signal)

1604009328-2615,"Scattered Light looks unusual (zoom out to frame 4!) when rendered with coarser frequency resolution and finer time resolution than usual...
Background:
Gravity Spy deals with glitches which may be of short or long duration, and which may be confined to a single frequency or span broad frequency bands. But there is a tradeoff between time and frequency resolution in our spectrograms. Each glitch is therefore preprocessed at four different settings for the ""Q-value"", 5.66 or 11.3 or 22.6 or 45.3 (the geometric midpoints of the intervals 4-8-16-32-64), and the one that gives the highest signal-to-noise ratio is used to render the image. Low Q-values correspond to fine time resolution at the expense of coarse frequency resolution, emphasizing short-duration broadband features. High Q-values correspond to coarse time resolution and fine frequency resolution.
Gravity Spy subjects from the third observation run O3 and the preceding Engineering Runs have the chosen Q-value included in their metadata (click on the (i)nfo button under the image). With some experience, one can guess the Q-value from whether the background noise texture looks more vertical or more horizontal.
Many glitch classes are most visible at a particular Q-value, and thus most often appear at that Q-value: E.g., Blips at 5.66, Crowns (from Livingston) at 11.3, Damped Crowns / Coronets (a proposed class) at 22.6, and Scattered Light at 45.3.
But sometimes we see them rendered at a different Q-value - often (not always) when glitches of different kinds occur side by side - and then the visual appearance can change, subtly or dramatically. The ""trees"" in the Gravity Spy logo subject 13741669 are what Blips and Koi Fish look like when rendered at Q 45.3.

This sounds almost exactly like a Reddit style format... Where a mod has content control over their discussion. Same thing with the hostile takeover aspect.

I do know Reddit, but don't know there forum features. At GS Talk, the topic OP (Original Poster) would still only have controle over there own first post. ... Post-controle which, as far as I know, can't be transferred to someone else at Zooniverse. Ergo: the (virtual) hostile (but it could also be a friendly) takeover idea.

It could work but is overly complex in my opinion.

I think the complexity here is somewhat relative and subjective. With the current Zooniverse Talk features, I don't see an easier way. ... Other than coming up with a better documentation on the idea.
If you see an alternative/easier way, I'm all ears. 

My argument, which is really a side topic from your discussion, is that tags that are able to be defined specific to certain glitches, should be a new classification category.

Well that's up to the GS team. Some things to keep in mind here are:

Currently, as I understand it, a Zooniverse projects looses there 'Approved' status when changes are made to the project files (which is a subject that's under discussion at Zooniverse level.).
Even whiteout point 1 the project user community is generally more flexible and will probably spot new signals before the GS team does.
Currently the GS project setup seems not yet geared for speedy addition of new signals. This might change in the future, but they still will need some time to study potential new signals before deciding to include them (or not) in the official classification process.


it seems like to me only maybe 10 to 20% would dig that deep and find it helpful

I don't really find that relevant.
""According to the U.S. Census Bureau, as of 2012, 8.05 percent of the population in the United States ages 25 and older has a master's degree. Another 3.07 percent has gone one step further and has a doctoral or professional degree.""

to see and understand potentially hundreds of tag categories on top of 20 classification categories.

I don't think ""potentially hundreds of user-named-signals"" are to be expected, ... although that could depend on the signal-hashtag-list maintainer. Needles to say some quality controle is implied here. And than there is also the fact that signals could go away again, like this signal did.

It gets complicated... and maybe that's a good reason to ax the idea...

I think the basic idea is relative simple, and only has one real goal. There might be some potential problems with it. But those seem at this point more virtual than real.

but as I see them... tags shouldn't be to classify.

Here I'm not sure to what your revering to. As there is no direct classification intend attached to the basic OP (Original Post) idea, as least not in my mind.

They should be to help create new categories to then include them into a tool that does help them be official classified.

Some very long discussion threads are associated with gold-standard subjects - those which serve to train us volunteers, and which provide feedback - and these do get shown to very many people. (And many entries in longer threads arise as replies to earlier entries, not directly from clicking Done & Talk in the Classifier.)
For all other subjects - those where our submissions help to train the Machine Learning - there is no fixed number of classifications. The software keeps a score of what has been submitted and what the ML itself has come up with, and deduces a confidence estimate about how reliable the classification already is, updating it with every new submission. Subjects which don't converge on a glitch class eventually migrate to a more advanced workflow.
The researchers, at any time, can run queries against the Gravity Spy database asking for e.g. all glitches from Hanford that happened during O3 and which are deemed to be Whistles with a confidence of at least 85%. And so on.
Unlike many other Zooniverse projects, subjects never get completed/retired automatically after a given number of classifications or after exceeding a given confidence threshold - retirements only happen when the researchers run a customized batch job. (This happens very rarely, and thus what Zooniverse is able to display about the Gravity Spy completion percentage, total or per workflow, is always deceptively low. And it has kept decreasing whenever the detectors have been up and running and several thousand subjects per day got freshly uploaded...)
On average, to date, each subject has received less than 2 classifications - we're standing at 1,624,836 subjects at present and approaching 2.9 million classifications.

Noise and signal criterion is valid for any instrumental analytical chemistry technique, not only spectroscopical ones, and widespread accepted and known in analytical chemistry community. The noise is assumed to have a Normal distribution, the corresponding standard error is the baseline for computing the 3-fold threshold (for a significance level enabling to be mistaken less than 1% times). Then, 3 is the Normal ""percentile"" generally adopted, so any peak in the noisy data being 1.5 or 2 times higher than the noise spread is often taken as a noise itself. But peaks which ""lift off"" above the background with an intensity 3 times higher than the standard error of the noise can be classified as a truly signal (analytical signal is the technical term) --then one expects to be mistaken with a probability below 1%. Notice that a percentile 2 or 1.96 would make us to be mistaken about the nature of the signal-candidate about 5% of times, 1 time per 20 attempts! I really believe the 1D definition of signal to noise ratio can straightforward be generalized to a 2D phase-space like that of glitches,. By observing how great is the fluctuation in a #noglitch image you can compute (by the triple of this amount) the minimum peak to be taken as a non-noisy and truly glitch. Strictly speaking, peak height should be measured from the top values of noise for applying the 3-sigmas threshold, but I start to count from a 0 energy in the pictures (noisy background fluctuation uses to be close to 3 units, seldom is 5, please verify it). Color-scales helps so much!
Not being a geologist, 100 Hz vibrations are very well explained by you, but I wonder if a seismic origin is feasible. For the dimensions of the beam tube, I cannot realize now how the wind could act on it (unless there is a hurricane or wild wind involved ), but external supports can give a clue. Low frequency events or waves in the floor may excite vibrational modes in the structure. Wavy-trains with one half second endurance, a regular pattern I could detect in my collection, would imply an almost constant relaxation time --I suspect a Fourier analysis (if possible) of the glitches can help to characterize them.
I confess classical wave mechanics is not my best friend, but your explanation is very good whatever is the reason of the #midfrequencyline glitches.
The non-filtered occurrence of midfreq lines close to 2-3% is another helpful parameter, since low frequency noise uses to be intense (it is well known the ""1/f law of noises"" affecting devices and equipment in analytical chemistry, where f is frequency). LIGO exhibits this pattern clearly below 10 Hz, from the pictures I could see in LSC webpage.
Thank you very much, and ask as much as needed about my ""3-fold criterion"" if you want. Regards!

1604198850-1454,"2. HFB500 - pizzicato
(Candidate) training set pizzicato
Link to collection metadata
Sources for this candidate training set:

ER14 hfb500 by @EcceruElme
subjects mentioned in talk over the last few months by @AardvarkNick, @bamboo69, @Christingle, @Imvoib, @MonsieurFrey, @nepcwtch, @Pjs62600, @Pony_Rider, @SrirangCanTransit, and @UnbiasedBrigade
subjects noted by myself whilst classifying them (as NOTA so far)
subjects noted in #simsearch results apropos of subjects also belonging to this proposed new class
subjects coming up serendipitously in #simsearch results apropos of subjects of other types

Properties and known biases of the training set:
I consciously aimed for covering the whole timeline from ER14 when these glitches were first noted, through early and late O3a when they began to show up also at the higher frequency, through early O3b when (in the presence of a persistently rung-up 1017Hz violin mode) they were very frequent at Livingston for a while, all the way into the present month. The peak in the first three weeks of November 2019 (amounting to 55% of the training set) is, if anything, under-represented: Subjects from this time make up fully 80% of my own ""pizzicato"" collection which, however, under-represents ER14 (since I joined Gravity Spy only in August 2019, by which time O3 subjects began to drown out those from the earlier eras in Gravity Spy). December 2019 and January 2020 will be under-represented in any case since these subjects have only recently been uploaded to Gravity Spy and have not yet been seen by many contributors. Even so, we have recent examples from both Hanford and Livingston.
The 94-member candidate set is free of duplicates. It spans SNRs from 7.503 to 67.3. It reflects the variability in morphology, with the characteristic central bulge-with-a-whole at either ~512Hz or ~1024Hz or sometimes both, with or without lateral ""wings"", with or without vertical (""lighthouse"") extensions, often appearing alone but occasionally in combination with fainter noise at lower frequencies or with bright glitches of other types, e.g. Scattered Light. (Only examples where the present type is near t=0 and brighter than the other type are included.)
Motivation:
These glitches keep occurring... and aren't all that rare. They are easy to classify by humans, and the machine, once properly trained, should also be able to do a good job on them. (And it would be useful to have the classification option available in the advanced levels.)
SimSearch suggests that the ML sometimes already does a fairly good job at clustering these - e.g. 200 from H1+L1 based on 38015308 finds only a small number of whistles, rung-up violins, and one subject without anything visible above 500Hz as false positives. Do the same starting from 32908659 from early O3a, however, and the returned subjects at present are widely scattered, with a large fraction of HF Bursts, Whistles, showers, etc, even among the upper 50% of the similarity scores.
Any comments / suggestions / criticism before we do anything else with this set? @researchers
Thanks in advance!

1604198717-1105,"Some definitions will be proposed here, trying to enhance our probabilities of constructing a clever tool for studying the signals in the context of a well-characterized background (noise).
It is known that language alters the way we think, idioms with many words for describing some sort of experiences allow a high sensitive power for ascertaining subtle differences. The glossary I will try to present below is designed with the purpose of letting us think in a richer way. The aim is to recognize noise patterns as easily as possible, to avoid the distraction of our attention (by apophenia or fake signals).
Glossary
Texture: set of common features observed in several samples of spectrograms, within the zone of noise or noisy background. Each texture is described by the shape, direction, color and frequency of the features.
Uniform or smooth noise: Zone where the noise does not exhibit a noticeable variation of the normalized energy, when it is observed with the naked eye.
An example of this texture is shown in frame 1 of the spectrogram Hanford-O2a. Watch the zones between 64 and 256 Hz, please. Uniform dark color is sometimes crossed by slightly discernible horizontal lines, whose normalized energy is below 1 --and perhaps are minor to 0.5. The smooth texture corresponds to the domains with almost null normalized energy. It can be discussed if low energy lines belong to the texture or not, and if criteria for defining them as a separate domain rely on shape, normalized energy or both properties. More than 90% of the surface from frame 1 in this spectrogram, ranging from 64 to 256 Hz, can be said to be smooth or uniform, regardless the classification of the aforementioned lines with 0.5-1 units of normalized energy.
Note: high frequency limit for smooth domain might be 512 Hz, however I circumvented the discusion about the new texture seen above and very close this limit. The main objective here is to provide a clean picture of the texture, far from the boundaries and the subtle variations naturally occurring there.

1604199645-2693,"So, I've started to dabble with using collections, and I've come across a few issues that are deal breakers for my continued use of them. So, I though I'd offer a few suggestions on what I would like to see added.

When searching through the forum using hashtags or just a general search, there needs to be a way to change the view of every subject listed. I can't use the search tool currently and find the kind of subject I'm looking for. It currently requires a click through to each subject to then change the view that might be required to see if it matches a collection I'm trying to find subjects for. One recent search I wish I had this on recently was over 700 subjects! I can't possibly click through each. This has been requested multiple times from many different people and with other categories coming and many more subjects this is a requirement as I see it. It's not a wish I had. It's a must have.

1a)  After a search, there should be a way to select multiple subjects and add them easily to a collection. Subjects already selected, should have a visual reminder of their selection and should remain selected across multiple pages of the search results (like when clicking to page 2 or 3 of the search results). There could be a select all button and a deselect all button along with a counter as to the number of currently selected subjects (which tracks across multiple search pages). Then one final button to add the selected subjects to a collection.

This suggestion, might as well actually be a bug... if you're viewing a collection for which you are not a collaborator. And you use the select multiple subjects option and go to multiple pages with your multiple selections AND one of the subjects you've selected is already in your collection... you get a rather uninspiring red error message about it already being in your collection. No subjects are then added to your collection. It doesn't list the subject number that is already in your collection so you can't even figure out which one is messing everything up. The best option would be to have it add all of the subjects that are selected (because you DO want them added) and when it confirms they were added just list how many were newly added and how many were duplicates.

These are my current thoughts, and I encourage anyone who uses collections to contribute ideas.

At level 4 and earlier, they can be classified as None Of The Above, but you can already make a collection of them and study their variability. They are fairly common at Livingston.
Low Frequency Bursts should indeed touch (even reach beyond, although we can't see that) the bottom edge at 10Hz.

1604531160-650,"Welcome to Gravity Spy Talk, and well observed!
Yes, these features are processing artefacts. Both the time resolution and the frequency resolution of our spectrograms are limited, and there's a tradeoff between the two, and the time resolution at lower frequencies is always coarser than at higher frequencies (e.g. twice as coarse at 128Hz than it is at 256Hz). The present subject was processed with fairly fine frequency resolution, by matching sine wave trains with about 20 crests and troughs at various frequencies to the signal at various points in time; thus the time resolution is relatively coarse and everything has got stretched out horizontally to some extent.

1604648931-13168,"It only took seconds to configure a search of INJ in November 2016. The logs are interesting but I am not authorised to access most of the links. There were quite a few hardware injections. I understand what you mean about old data with regards to glitches but data due to GW injected or real is exactly the same, constant through all eras and of course in GS chirps are glitches so we are always being duofunctional. 
Interestingly ICECUBE detected a neutrino on 03/11/2016 follow up analyses were performed but results were not definitive. Was GW follow up done if it was not perhaps someone should do it now.

However, at the bottom half of the plot on the cartesian/coordinate plane, the trailing off and the inconsistency of the glitch troubles and confuses me (I have only been doing Gravity Spy for a short while as of now). I ultimately decided that the glitch appeared to be more of the whistle sort than the blip sort. Just wanted to point out my own confusion for the resource of others.
Also, if anyone would be willing to reach out and provide some assistance to me regarding better identifying glitches, I would definitely appreciate that. Thanks!
